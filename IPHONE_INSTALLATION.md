# 📱 iPhone Installation Guide

## ⚠️ Important: APK Files Don't Work on iPhone

**APK files are Android-only** and cannot be installed on iPhone/iPad.

- **APK** = Android Package (for Android devices)
- **IPA** = iOS App Store Package (for iPhone/iPad)
- These are **completely different** formats

## 🎯 Your Options for iPhone

### Option 1: Build an iOS Version (Recommended for Native App)

To run this app on iPhone, we need to create an iOS version. This requires:

**Requirements:**
- Mac computer (required for iOS development)
- Xcode (free from Mac App Store)
- Apple Developer Account ($99/year for App Store, free for personal testing)
- Rewrite app in Swift or use React Native/Flutter

**Steps:**
1. Install Xcode on Mac
2. Create new iOS project
3. Rewrite the Android Kotlin code to Swift
4. Build and install on iPhone

**Time Required:** Several hours to days (depending on experience)

Convert the app to a web app that works in iPhone's Safari browser.

**Advantages:**

**How it works:**

Run the Android app on your computer and access it remotely.
